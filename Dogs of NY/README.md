This project was aimed to make a basic analysis of the dog population in NYC using a semipublic data base
from the Department of health (DOH) of the city that keeps a record of the requested number of licences for
dog ownership in the city; the basic idea was to develop a set of basic descriptive statistics related to the
database in terms of the dogs names, sex and most populaar races, and aggregate their quantities based on 
zip codes in the 5 boroughs; finally the idea was try to create a heath map to visually asses the number of dogs
in the city, but use a meassurement of the dog density (number of dogs per sqr mile), to compare both of 
them.

On the second part of the project, I obtained a list of the parks and dog runs that allow the presence of dogs in
NYC from the Department of NYC parks (published in XML format); using a specialized function in Python, I was
able to pinpoint their specific location using google maps and plot them, separating the dog runs from the parks;
in the last part I tried to overlay the data from the first notebook (dog density) and the parks and run to 
visually asses the lack or excess of parks and runs when compared o dog density for each area.
