areas of New York City; the index includes data from Median house value, median rent values, % of white population in 
the area, % of college graduates in the areas, poverty levels and median household income; the selected area to evaluate

gentrification index were made between thee top gentrifying neighborhoods by 2009 and the adjacent areas
