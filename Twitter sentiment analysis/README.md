The following notebooks were created with the aim of performing a baasic tweeter setntiment analysis related 
to the colombian peace treaty announced in the last months by the Colombian goverment and the FARC guerrillas.

The first Jupyter Notebook called "TASS database for sentiment analysis" contains the load and preprocessing of the 
privately owned TASS database that was used for the training of the analytical model I created in order to asses the 
polarity of the downloaded tweets.

The second Jupyter notebook called 'Tweet Mining and basic sentiment analysis" contains the actual mining process
thta I used to obtain the related tweets in a specific period of time, the preprocessing of the tweets, the analysis
I performed, and the visualizations I created; finally, the file also contains the analyticl model created, the cross-
validation process and tuning, and the final projected results with the correspondent visualizations.
